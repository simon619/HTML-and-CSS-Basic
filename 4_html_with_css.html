    <h1>MIT</h1>
    <p>
        At MIT, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and possibility is our joyful obsession, 
        and we celebrate fundamental discoveries and practical applications alike. As educators, 
        we also value research as a potent form of learning by doing. Through MITâ€™s Undergraduate 
        Research Opportunities Program (UROP), more than 85% of undergraduates enrich their 
        education through engaging in frontline, faculty-led research.

        <h2>MIT Produces The Best Engineers In The World</h2>
        <p>
            Research flourishes in our 30 departments across five schools and one college, as well 
            as in dozens of centers, labs, and programs that convene experts across disciplines to 
            explore new intellectual frontiers and attack important societal problems. Our on-campus 
            research capabilities are enhanced through the work of MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Woods 
            Hole Oceanographic Institution, active research relationships with industry, and a wide 
            range of global collaborations. In this work, the MIT Libraries serve as a crucial partner 
            and a source of important research in their own right.
