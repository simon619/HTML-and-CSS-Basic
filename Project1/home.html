            <h2>It's a me, Mario</h2>
            <p>
                One day the kingdom of the peaceful mushroom people was invaded by the Koopa, 
                a tribe of turtles famous for their black magic. The quiet, peace-loving Mushroom 
                People were turned into mere stones, bricks and even field horsehair plants, and 
                the Mushroom Kingdom fell into ruin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only one who can undo the magic spell on the Mushroom People and return them to 
                their normal selves is the Princess Toadstool, the daughter of the Mushroom King. 
                Unfortunately, she is presently in the hands of Bowser, the King of the Koopa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mario hears about the Mushroom People's plight and sets out on a quest to free the 
                Mushroom Princess from the evil Koopa and restore the fallen kingdom of the Mushroom 
                People. You are Mario! It's up to you to save the Mushroom People from the black magic 
                of the Koopa!
