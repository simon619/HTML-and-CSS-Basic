            As the world marvels over the first public images from the James Webb Space Telescope, 
            Webb Deputy Project Manager for Technical Verification Paul Geithner is able to recall 
            another first-of-its-kind moment: when the Webb team thought for a brief — blessedly 
            brief — moment it had actually broken part of the observatory.
        </p>

        <p class="blue">
            A portion of the Webb structure, custom-made of graphite epoxy composite, underwent 
            vibration testing at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in late 2016. Connection points 
            in the instrument's deployable components were stressed to see how they would hold up. 
            All was going well, until it wasn't. There was a loud crack. The sound wasn't pretty.
        </p>

        <p class="red">
            “People said 'Oh my god, did we just break it?” Geithner remembers. “I mean, it 
            sounded bad. Then the test automatically shut down. That was probably the scariest point.”
        </p>

        <p>
            No harm was done. Tuned mass dampers were added to the telescope's secondary mirror support 
            structure to suppress any resonances that would threaten the structure's survival during launch. 
            Testing then, and in the months and several years to come, continued as the mission team assessed 
            the observatory's hardiness for the extreme conditions it would encounter, both during launch and 
            in its eventual permanent Lagrange Point 2 (L2) “halo” orbit — larger than the size of the Moon's 
            orbit around Earth — gravitationally balanced between Earth and the Sun.
        </p>

        <p class ="red yellow">
            Webb's destination orbit is thanks to Italian-born 18th century mathematician and astronomer 
            Joseph-Louis Lagrange, who made important contributions to classical and celestial mechanics. Lagrange 
            studied the “three-body problem” (thus named because of three bodies that orbit one another) for the Earth, 
            Sun and Moon. He identified five points in near space — L1 through L5 — where objects could be easily 
            orbited.
